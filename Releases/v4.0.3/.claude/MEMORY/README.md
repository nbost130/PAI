# Memory System

PAI's memory system stores learnings, relationship context, and session data.

## Directories

- `LEARNING/` — Captured insights and patterns
- `RELATIONSHIP/` — Interaction preferences and history
- `STATE/` — Runtime state (auto-managed)
- `VOICE/` — Voice interaction logs

These directories are created automatically as needed.
