# Telos — Life OS

Your personal life operating system. Telos tracks goals, beliefs, challenges, and wisdom to help PAI understand what matters to you.

## Suggested Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `GOALS.md` | Your current goals (short, medium, long-term) |
| `BELIEFS.md` | Core beliefs and worldview |
| `CHALLENGES.md` | Current challenges and obstacles |
| `BOOKS.md` | Books that shaped your thinking |
| `FRAMES.md` | Mental models and frameworks you use |
| `WISDOM.md` | Collected wisdom and insights |
| `AUTHORS.md` | Thinkers and authors who influence you |

## Integration

The Telos skill reads these files to provide life-aware analysis. When you ask PAI to analyze a decision, it considers your goals, beliefs, and challenges for context-aware advice.
