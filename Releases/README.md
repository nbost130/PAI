# PAI Releases

## What Are Releases?

Releases are **complete `.claude/` directories** ready to drop into your home folder. Each release contains everything you need: skills, hooks, workflows, memory structure, and configuration.

This is the fastest way to get PAI running. Copy the directory, run the wizard, restart Claude Code.

> **Note:** The `.claude` directory is hidden by default on macOS/Linux. Use `ls -la` to see it.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure.git
cd Personal_AI_Infrastructure/Releases/v4.0.3

# 2. Copy the release and run the installer
cp -r .claude ~/ && cd ~/.claude && bash install.sh
```

The wizard asks for your name, AI name, timezone, temperature unit, and optional voice preferences.

See the [main README](../README.md#upgrading-from-a-previous-version) for upgrade instructions.

## Troubleshooting

**Can't see .claude directory?** It's hidden. Use `ls -la ~/` or press `Cmd+Shift+.` in Finder.

**Hooks not firing?** Restart Claude Code after installation.
